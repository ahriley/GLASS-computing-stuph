# GLASS: Computing Stuph (25 Jan 2019)

This is meant to be a super quick introduction to many of the computing tools/concepts that you will engage with in graduate school.  It is intended as a reference for the basics of each concept, as well as useful links I have found if you wish to dive a little deeper.  Remember, your fellow grads are excellent resources for all of this stuff, as well as Brother Google.

## Layout

Each file in this repo corresponds to a different concept or computing tool. You should be able to navigate pretty easily between everything, as well as `git clone` or download as a ZIP via the usual Github buttons. The topics cover (in alphabetical order):
* `clusters`: how to work on a computer that is not your own (supercomputers fall under this)
* `conda`: also covers package management (`pip` falls under this as well)
* `config`: these are your `.bash_profile`s and the like
* `git`: version control (also covering Github as a bonus)
* `python-tricks`: self explanatory

## Helpful links
* [This Markdown cheatsheet](https://github.com/adam-p/markdown-here/wiki/Markdown-Cheatsheet) was basically open the entire time I was typing these
